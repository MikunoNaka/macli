 * exists the value in the config file will be used
 * this works but flags won't be able to take precedence
 *
 * i.e if the value in config file is 6 but I want to set it to 5 through
 * flags, it will see that the value is the default value so it'll use
 * the value in the macli.yaml file which is 6. in this case the
 * flags aren't taking precedence. fix that! */
