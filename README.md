# macli
Unofficial CLI-Based MyAnimeList Client

### Notice:
macli is currently highly under development, so many obvious features may not be present.

## How to install
If you have go installed on your system, simply run `go install github.com/MikunoNaka/macli@latest`

Make sure you have your $GOPATH set up properly if you have issues running `macli` globally

If you use an Arch-based distro and too lazy to set up your $GOPATH you can use the AUR package `macli-git` but I won't guarantee that it would build without any problems.

Visit the [macli](https://www.vidhukant.xyz/projects/macli) page on my website for more info.
