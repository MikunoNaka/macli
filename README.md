Unofficial CLI-Based MyAnimeList Client

[official website](https://macli.vidhukant.com/)

## How to install

If you use an Arch-based distro and too lazy to set up your $GOPATH you can use the AUR package `macli-git` or `macli` for the bin package.

If you have go installed on your system, simply run `go install vidhukant.com/macli@latest`
(Make sure you have your $GOPATH set up properly if you have issues running `macli` globally)

You can also check out the [releases](https://macli.vidhukant.com/releases/) for other pre-built binaries. 

## How to use

Run `macli --help` for instructions or check out the macli website.
