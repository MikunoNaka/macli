# macli

Unofficial CLI-Based MyAnimeList Client

## How to install

If you use an Arch-based distro and too lazy to set up your $GOPATH you can use the AUR package `macli-git`

If you have go installed on your system, simply run `go install github.com/MikunoNaka/macli@latest`
(Make sure you have your $GOPATH set up properly if you have issues running `macli` globally)

You can also check out the releases for pre-built binaries. [latest release](/MikunoNaka/macli/releases/latest)

## How to use

Run `macli --help` for instructions
